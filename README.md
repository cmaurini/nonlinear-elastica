# Nonlinear Beam Model: Elastica

This repository demonstrates the numerical solution of a nonlinear models inextensible, unshearable planar beam under external loading.
It illustrates the deformation of a cnatilever beam under a transverse tip load and its bukling under a compressive axial force


## Features

- Symbolic formulation with [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/)
- Constrained optimization using [IPOPT](https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/)
- Two examples:
  - Vertical tip load without imperfection
  - Axial compression with initial curvature imperfection

## Mathematical Model

The beam minimizes the energy:

- Bending energy with inelastic curvature
- Work of vertical and axial tip forces

Inextensibility is enforced via nonlinear constraints between the orientation of the tangent vector and the derivative of the position vector.

## üì¶ Installation

Install using conda:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate elastica
jupyter notebook
```
